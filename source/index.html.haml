%section#abstract
  %p
    I am excited about <em>data products</em> - from the <em>ML</em> through the <em>data infrastructure</em> up to the <em>UX</em>.
    I've worn many hats like data engineer, <em>data scientist</em>, data <em>product manager</em>, product analyst (even full-stack web developer).
    I have built and <em>led teams</em> building data products.
    I speak many programming languages - preferrably functional ones.
    Founder of a data for good non-profit.
