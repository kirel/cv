  I am excited about <em>data products</em> - from the <em>ML</em> through the <em>data infrastructure</em> up to the <em>UX</em>.
  I've worn many hats like data engineer, <em>data scientist</em>, data <em>product manager</em>, product analyst (even full-stack web developer).
  I have built and <em>led teams</em> building data products.
  I speak many programming languages - preferrably functional ones.
